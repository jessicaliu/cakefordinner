  <center>Hi, I'm Jessica! This is mah weeebsite!</center>
  <p/>
  Now here is a story of my life, because OBVIOUSLY THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE HERE FOR. :D
</div>

<h2 class="h-about">birth</h2>
I was born 21 years ago in Hanover, NH. I almost died on the way out so my mom had to get a c-section which makes me a lot like Caesar!! Also I didn't die. Good work mom and doctors!!! No pictures because that's gross. Ew.

<h2 class="h-about">fat baby</h2>


When I was a baby, I was fat as fuck.
<p/>
That's me looking like an obese man. My mom was much prettier than me, as you can probably tell. But since I was a baby and mindless, I felt no jealousy.

<h2 class="h-about">boring pre-college life</h2>
Lived in the <a href="images/house.jpg" target="_blank">woods</a> for 18 years, blah blah blah. This part couldn't be more dull, so I'm skipping it.

<h2 class="h-about">today</h2>
Okay, well that look less time than I thought it would. Anyways, this is now. Now I am 21 years old.  I'm a senior at Brown University studying Computer Science and Visual Arts and other random stuff. Ever since I got here, my life has been AWESOME, 100% thanks to the wonderful, brilliant, hilarious, supermegafoxyawesomehot people that surround and support me. AHHHILOVETHEMSOMUCH. Especially <a href="http://rykap.com" target="_blank">Ryan Kaplan</a>. :D
<p/>
Last summer I found out that San Francisco is the best city in the world, so that's where I'm going to live when I grow up!

<h2 class="h-about">shit I forgot something important</h2>
While I was skipping all the stupid parts of my life, I left out something critical. I have a dog! His name is Feifei, and <a href="images/feifei.jpg" target="_blank">he is the cutest thing in the world holyshitholyshit</a>.
